# guac-is-extra
This is a simple Node app with an Express API for returning taco recipes.

Note: this API is running in a free Heroku dyno so it may take a minute to spin up, be patient ðŸ˜Œ


## Using the public API

This API only has a single GET request at the root `/`. This will return all the recipe data.

### Filter recipes by name
To filter recipes by name, use the `name` query parameter

```
GET https://guac-is-extra.herokuapp.com/?name=fish
```

### Filter recipes by included ingredients
To filter recipes by included ingredients, use the `includeIngredients` query parameter

```
GET https://guac-is-extra.herokuapp.com/?includeIngredients=pork
```

To filter by more than one ingredient, comma separate them. Note: this does an OR query returning recipes that have any of the comma separated ingredients.

```
GET https://guac-is-extra.herokuapp.com/?includeIngredients=pork,bacon,ham
```

### Filter recipes by excluded ingredients
To filter recipes by excluded ingredients, use the `excludeIngredients` query parameter. This will return recipes that do not included the filtered ingredient.

```
GET https://guac-is-extra.herokuapp.com/?excludeIngredients=pork
```

To filter by more than one ingredient, comma separate them. Note: this does an OR query returning recipes that don't have one or more of the comma separated ingredients.

```
GET https://guac-is-extra.herokuapp.com/?excludeIngredients=pork,bacon,ham
```
